#### Project description and goal <a name="part-1"></a>
The project entails designing an online healthcare platform for chronic diseases, specifically Post-Covid conditions. The project is divided into two stages, the first being need finding, and the second being prototyping the product. My goal in this project is to design a user-friendly platform that can help patients suffering from Post-Covid conditions to get access to the right healthcare services.

#### Learning and execution process<a name="part-2"></a>
At the beginning of the project, I started with drawing the draft of the prototype by hand. I wanted to create a rough idea of what I wanted the healthcare platform to look like and how it would function. This allowed me to visualize the platform and think about the user experience. I also created a user persona based on my research to understand the needs and goals of my target audience.

As the project progressed, I learned how to create a digital prototype using MasterGo. MasterGo is a popular design tool that allows designers to create digital prototypes with ease. It enabled me to quickly create screens and elements for the healthcare platform. I started with creating wireframes to define the layout and structure of the platform. Then, I added details to the screens to create a more realistic experience for the user. One of the most exciting parts of the project was learning how to add transition animations to the prototype.

Designing and creating a prototype for an online healthcare platform for chronic diseases was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I learned a lot about the design process and prototyping, which is also a valuable experience.

#### Responsibility in the group and achievement<a name="part-3"></a>
My contribution and responsibility in the group can be divided into two phases.

#### phase I<a name="part-3-sub-part-1"></a>
The first phase of the project involved need finding, where I conducted user research to understand the needs and pain points of patients suffering from Post-Covid conditions. I was responsible for validating our ideation by speed dating. I interviewed with some classmates and ask them with the designated questions. The validation results are in the following picture:

Through this process, I gained valuable insights into the challenges faced by patients and healthcare providers, which helped me to identify the features and functionalities required in the platform. My insights are: 1. Establish collaboration among hospitals. Build a large ecosystem of medical healthcare 2. Provide comprehensive and transparent guidelines for medical costs 3. Provide patients with a seamless online experience inside and outside the hospital.

#### phase II<a name="part-3-sub-part-2"></a>
The second phase of the project involved prototyping the product, where I used design thinking principles to create a user-centered platform. I used tools such as Sketch to create wireframes and mockups of the platform. The prototyping phase allowed me to test and validate my design ideas, and I received feedback from my peers and instructors, which helped me to refine the design.

In addition, I was responsible for making the slides for presentation. I made a part of slides including reacap of phase I, design of key features and using design heuristics for evaluation.

#### Personal reflection<a name="part-4"></a>
Throughout this course project, I learned various concepts and techniques related to human-computer interaction, including design thinking, user research, usability testing, and prototyping. I also gained knowledge about the healthcare industry and the challenges faced by patients suffering from Post-Covid conditions. I learned how to design a user-centered platform that can meet the needs of the users and provide a seamless user experience.

This project was a great learning experience for me. I learned the importance of user research and the value of user-centered design in creating a successful product. I also learned how to work effectively in a team and how to communicate my design ideas effectively. This project has helped me to develop my skills as a designer and has prepared me to tackle real-world design challenges in the future.
