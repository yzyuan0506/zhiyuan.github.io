#### Project description and goal <a name="part-1"></a>
The project entails designing an online healthcare platform for chronic diseases, specifically Post-Covid conditions. The project is divided into two stages, the first being need finding, and the second being prototyping the product. My goal in this project is to design a user-friendly platform that can help patients suffering from Post-Covid conditions to get access to the right healthcare services.

#### Personal reflection<a name="part-4"></a>
Throughout this course project, I learned various concepts and techniques related to human-computer interaction, including design thinking, user research, usability testing, and prototyping. I also gained knowledge about the healthcare industry and the challenges faced by patients suffering from Post-Covid conditions. I learned how to design a user-centered platform that can meet the needs of the users and provide a seamless user experience.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me. I learned the importance of user research and the value of user-centered design in creating a successful product. I also learned how to work effectively in a team and how to communicate my design ideas effectively. This project has helped me to develop my skills as a designer and has prepared me to tackle real-world design challenges in the future.
