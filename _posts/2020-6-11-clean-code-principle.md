title:  "Clean Code: KISS and DRY"
---

**KISS** --- keep it simple and stupid

**DRY** --- don't repeat yourself

Things need your attension:
1. Readability (everyone could understand!)
2. Comment, grammar, naming
3. Functionality, don't write god function (each function for one purpose)
4. Security
