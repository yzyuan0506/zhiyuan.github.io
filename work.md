These are some of my open-source work, although there are few people use them.

I have also done the course projects of some well-known CS courses, such as MIT6.824 (distributed systems), CMU15-445 (database systems), and Stanford CS142 (web development). But due to academic integrity, I won't open source my solutions. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me and have a discussion.
